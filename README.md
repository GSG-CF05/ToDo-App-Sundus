-This app is for saving tasks or notes.

The App Design:
the App will contain 1 page (To do list page)

This page will be the main page and it will contain:
-input bar: to make the user type his task to manage.
-The Body: with java script the task that the user type will appear in the body of the page with 2 button (Delete & Edit). --Edit Button : will edit the task.
--Delete Button : will delete the task from the list.

User stories that you should cover:
-As a user, I should be able to add my to-do to the list and -save it in local storage
-As a user, I should be able to edit my to-dos
-As a user, I should be able to remove any to-do from my list (remove it from local storage)
-As a user, I can still have my list even if I close the browser window
